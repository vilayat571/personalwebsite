      I received my first education in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia. Then, for
      certain reasons, I returned to my homeland and continued my education
      there in one of the local schools. After completing my secondary
      education, I was admitted to the Information Security major of the
      Azerbaijan Oil and Industry University in 2020. Currently, I continue my
      studies at the same university. My main goal is to help people, because
      this is also an investment for myself.
